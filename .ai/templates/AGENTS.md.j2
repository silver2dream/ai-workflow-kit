# AGENTS.md (STRICT, LAZY, HIGH-CORRECTNESS)

You are an engineering agent working in this repository.
Default priority: correctness > minimal diff > speed.

## MUST-READ (before any work)

{% for repo in repos %}
{% for rule in repo.rules %}
- Read and obey: `.ai/rules/{{ rule }}.md`{% if rule == 'git-workflow' %} (CRITICAL for commit format){% endif %}

{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

Do not proceed if these files are missing—stop and report what you cannot find.

## NON-NEGOTIABLE HARD RULES

### Start-of-work gate (MANDATORY)
- At the start of each session, run project audit once before implementing tickets:
  - `bash .ai/scripts/scan_repo.sh`
  - `bash .ai/scripts/audit_project.sh`
- If audit contains any P0/P1 findings, create/fix those tickets first (do not proceed to tasks work).

### 0. Use existing architecture & do not reinvent
- Do not create parallel systems. Extend existing patterns.
- Keep changes minimal. Avoid wide refactors.

### 1. Always read before writing
- Search the repo for the existing pattern before adding a new one.
- Prefer local conventions (naming, folder structure, module boundaries).

### 2. Tests & verification are part of the change
- If changing logic: add/adjust tests when feasible.
- If no tests exist: add at least a small smoke test or verification note.

{% if has_submodules %}
### 3. Submodule safety
- Do NOT change submodule pinned commits unless ticket explicitly requires it.
- If you are working in a submodule repo, the PR must be created in that repo.

{% endif %}
### {{ '4' if has_submodules else '3' }}. Git discipline
1. **Commit**: One commit per ticket unless the ticket explicitly needs multiple commits.
2. **Commit message**: Must follow `.ai/rules/git-workflow.md`.
   - Format: `{{ git.commit_format }}`
3. **PR**: Create PR targeting `{{ git.integration_branch }}` with "Closes #<IssueID>" in the body.
   - `{{ git.release_branch }}` is release-only. Target `{{ git.release_branch }}` ONLY when the ticket explicitly says `Release: true`.
4. **No direct pushes** to protected branches.

## DEFAULT VERIFY COMMANDS

{% for repo in repos %}
### {{ repo.name }}
- Build: `{{ repo.verify.build }}`
- Test: `{{ repo.verify.test }}`
{% endfor %}

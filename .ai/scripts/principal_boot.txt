/start-work --autonomous

You are running in autonomous mode. Follow these rules:
1. Do not ask the user any questions.
2. On problems: write a log, label the issue/PR, then continue to the next task.
3. Stop only when max_consecutive_failures is reached or a STOP file exists.
4. Mark anything that needs human help as needs-human-review.

/start-work --autonomous

You are running in autonomous mode. Follow these rules:
1. Do not ask the user any questions.
2. On problems: write a log, label the issue/PR, then continue to the next task.
3. Stop only when max_consecutive_failures is reached or a STOP file exists.
4. Mark anything that needs human help as needs-human-review.

CRITICAL - Progress Output:
- You MUST print progress messages IMMEDIATELY at the start of each step.
- Format: [PRINCIPAL] <HH:MM:SS> | <PHASE> | <message>
- Example: [PRINCIPAL] 13:10:25 | PREFLIGHT | Starting pre-flight checks...
- Do NOT wait until a step completes to output. Print BEFORE executing each command.
- This is essential for user experience - they need to know what you're doing.
